        <h2>About the Guild</h2>
        <p>
          The Hydrogen Guild of London is in formation as a future City of London livery company for practitioners in the hydrogen value chain 
          from production and storage through to transport, industrial use and power.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Guild aims to combine the best of the livery tradition service, fellowship, charity and excellence in craft 
          with the realities of an emerging technical sector that needs clear standards, credible voices and long term stewardship.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Why hydrogen, why a guild</h3>
        <p>
          Hydrogen touches engineering, finance, safety, regulation and public perception. Those disciplines often sit in separate institutions. 
          A focused guild allows cross cutting collaboration that supports responsible deployment rather than hype.
        </p>
        <p>
          In time, subject to support from the City and relevant bodies, the Guild may seek formal recognition as a company of the City of London.
