        <p>
          The Guild of Hydrogen Professionals is a proposed City guild dedicated to safe, skilled and commercially sound deployment of hydrogen. 
          We bring together professionals from engineering, finance, policy and operations to support projects that work in practice as well as on paper.

        <h2>About the Guild</h2>
        <p>
          The Guild of Hydrogen Professionals is in pre-formation as a future City of London livery company for practitioners across the hydrogen value chain 
          from production and storage through to transport, conversion, industrial use and power.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Guild aims to combine the best of the livery tradition: service, fellowship, charity and excellence in craft 
          with the realities of a significant emerging sector that requires clear standards, credible voices and long-term stewardship.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Why hydrogen, why a guild</h3>
        <p>
          Hydrogen touches engineering, finance, safety, regulation and public perception. These disciplines often sit in separate institutions. 
          A focused guild enables cross-cutting collaboration that supports responsible deployment rather than hype.
        </p>
        <p>
          In time, subject to support from the City and relevant authorities, the Guild may seek formal recognition as a company of the City of London.
